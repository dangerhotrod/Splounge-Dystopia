You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (in which are a security readout, a bowl (in which is a note) and a crazy looking gun) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench and a bartender here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, and a bartender here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see a dolphin code and a book here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which is a glittery box (in which is a bowl (empty))), a chair, a bench, and a bartender here.

You can go east through the airlock to the Veranda Walkway from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "yzxxy" as Wizex-zi. You are glad there is some way out of that Secret Room!

Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, and a bartender here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

(From here, you can move to north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west, up, and down.)

Overlooking Hallway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see a floating dolphin (empty) here.

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounce this as Xhi-zee.

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, and a bartender here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

(From here, you can move to north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west, up, and down.)

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which is a glittery box (in which is a bowl (empty))), a chair, a bench, and a bartender here.
