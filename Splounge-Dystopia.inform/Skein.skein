Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You sit down and are so comfortable - you could really get used to being in this chair. Really! Wowsers...it's just the comfiest thing you probably ever plopped yer can on...it's like you're almost part of this thing...like your skin is melding with it and your insides are turning to some sort of tiny little beans...or a kind of foam batting material...

"What a lovely soft and dreamy world", you think. Nothing is wrong and everything is right. Right and soft. Sooooo sooooofffft.

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (in which are a security readout, a bowl (in which is a note) and a crazy looking gun) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench and a bartender here.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see a dolphin code and a book here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, a bartender, a black ninja outfit, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock to the Veranda Walkway from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (empty) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, and a bartender here.

You can go east through the airlock to the Veranda Walkway from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

The weird ray somehow seems to bend around the bartender and disperses into a cloud of neon-swirled rainbow shards. She looks at you with a strange smirky side-eye. She must be wearing some kind of personal ray-deflector device. "splick", you admire-think.

At least that's what you were taught in data-download segment 2-histori-political info part 27A while syncing the standard edu-packets back in school. Now though, you find yourself inside of the massive hive known as CONvergence.

N is one.

Today's magic number is boring.

X is eleven!

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, a bartender, a black ninja outfit, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see AFrame here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

In the early 2000"s, mewonkind's folly led to the breakdown of society and the restructuring of general cultural and technological vector-goals. At least that's what you were taught in data-download segment 2-histori-political info part 27A while syncing the standard edu-packets back in school. Now though, you find yourself inside of the massive hive known as CONvergence.

N is more than the number of your toes.

Six is the magic number!

X is eleven!

Space Lounge
You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, a bartender, a black ninja outfit, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

The weird ray somehow seems to bend around the bartender and disperses into a cloud of neon-swirled rainbow shards. She looks at you with a strange smirky side-eye. She must be wearing some kind of personal ray-deflector device. "splick", you admire-think.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

(From here, you can move to north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west, up, and down.)

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see AFrame, a dolphin code, and a book here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock and a bartender here.

You can go east through the airlock to the Veranda Walkway from here.

You can see AFrame here.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Floating Courtyard (in the floating dolphin)
The floating dolphin is transparent, but tints everything outside very faintly lavender.

This is amazing - you are up above everything and can see so much up here! There's a pool down below, and a fenced in courtyard with some kind of security gate system surrounding it, and Consuite.

You can go down to the Veranda Walkway from here.

(From here, you can move to down.)

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, and a bartender here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

(From here, you can move to north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west, up, and down.)

Overlooking Hallway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see a floating dolphin (empty) here.

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounce this as Xhi-zee.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see AFrame, a dolphin code, and a book here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

The black ninja costume's pocket contains a throwing star and a smoke bomb.

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, a bartender, a black ninja outfit, AFrame, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

You sit down and are so comfortable - you could really get used to being in this chair. Really!

You'd rather be asleep. Whatever other thing you would do besides being in this chair is a bad idea and not really that good of an option compared to being in this insanely comfy chair.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, and a bartender here.

(From here, you can move to east.)

Welcome to Trivia, I'm your host, the disembodied voice coming from your device. We have only one rule; please don't cheat. Questions will be simple this round being worth five points a piece, but will increase in both difficulty and value as the game goes on. 

You can see no obvious exits.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

Veranda Walkway
Outside the Space Lounge you look out into the larger Raditree Building to see the pool with under a high ceiling. Consuite lies beyond the pool in the main courtyard. Boffers beat each other up in the fenced in section of the courtyard. A floating dolphin surveillance pod floats by making you twitch instintively to make your shiny wig come between the camera and your face.

You can see an airlock, a black rod, and a floating dolphin (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, southeast, west through the airlock to the Space Lounge, up, and down from here.

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (in which are a security readout and a bowl (in which is a note)) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, a bartender, a black ninja outfit, and a Security bot here.

You can go east through the airlock to the Veranda Walkway from here.

Secret Room
You are in the Secret Room. DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU WERE EVER HERE! It's really dark, you can't see much.

You can see AFrame, a dolphin code, and a book here.

You can see no obvious exits.

(There are no routes out of this room.)

Under the influence of the black rod, you pronounced "xyzzy" as Xhi-zee. You understand now that the purpose of the black rod is to bring people here, to the Secret Room.

You are in the Space Lounge, rumored to be the center of The Resistance. "Why did I come here?" you briefly wonder before looking around.

You can see an airlock, a bar (on which are a glittery box (closed) and a Glowing Sphere), a chair, a bench, a bartender, a black ninja outfit, and AFrame here.

You can go east through the airlock (closed) from here.

(From here, you can move to east.)
